# Dovark ALT Layouts
Two alternate Dvorak keyboard layouts

One with the only the IU keys swapped.
The other with the IU and LM keys swapped

## Installation
Mac:
Dowlnoad the .DMG file of the layout you want and move the .keylayout file to the alias inside the folder i.e. `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.

PC:
Download the PC version of the file (Sorry there is no IU & LM version for PC) extract and open setup.exe. Then select the keyboard layout in the input sources.

## Motivation and theory
After [analyzing](http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer/) other keyboard layouts like colemak, workman, and norman I came to the conclusion that I could get most of the benefits of these layouts in Dvorak without switching to them by simply swapping the I and U keys.

'I' is much more frequently used in English than 'U' so putting it directly under a finger on the home row makes for less movement of the fingers which should lead to faster typying speed. One should theoretically move their fingers less on this layout than on the traditional Dvorak layout. Dvorak with IU swapped performed better than some of these layouts in certain situations.

The same is also true for the 'L' and 'M' keys. While L is used much more frequently it makes sense to put it in a position that does not strain the right pinky. This also has the added benefit of reducing the strain on the right pinky which is a great win.

## Personal experience
I have been using the DvorakIU swap keyboard layout since 2009.

It took me about a week and a half of using this new layout until I was up to my old speed on the official Dvorak layout. In the end I found it easier on the hands than the normal Dvorak layout.

I have been using the DvorakIULM swap since 2018 and so far have really been enjoying it. Time to switch was about two weeks to get back to normal typing speed.

## Credits
The mac file was created with [Ukelele V3](https://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) and should work on all versions of MacOS. The PC files where created a long time ago and I don't know if they still work, PRs welcome.
